# Project-Zomato-Data-Analysis

  <h1>🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis</h1>
  <p>
    This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Zomato restaurant dataset, with the aim of deriving actionable insights from restaurant-related data across various Indian cities. The dataset includes features such as restaurant name, location, cuisine types, average cost for two, ratings, votes, and whether online ordering or table booking is available. These features were analyzed to understand patterns in consumer preferences, restaurant performance, and operational trends in the food delivery and hospitality industry.
